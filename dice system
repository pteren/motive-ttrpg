dice system

things i want:
- rolls should feel grounded, reliable.
- ability to stack advantages to ensure success (like blades)
- plot armor? OR 
- some interesting resources




making a move against an npc:

- pc declares which goal they are targeting.

- each 5-6 is a HIT. pc gets to shift the target goal in the declared direction. or perhaps destroy a goal if there are enough hits?
- each 1 is BACKLASH. gm gets to shift a *different* goal in a direction of their choice. or evoke unexpected emotions. or perhaps create a new goal if there is enough backlash.



initiative moves to the target of the previous move!!!




emotions: resources the gm can spend to boost npc moves


      fear resists fool
      fool causes anger
     anger resists fraternize
fraternize causes joy
       joy resists force
     force causes fear



NPC may spend 1 emotion to "resist" (block 1 hit) the appropriate approach

NPC moves:
- inflict conditions?
- alter surroundings?
- steal "time" from pcs?
- gain leverage
- deal hits to the goals of allies
- deal hits to the goals of minions
- manage emotions

npcs get dice based on which goals they are invoking?
maybe multiple at once
